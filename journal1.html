JOURNAL ENTRIES <a href="index.html">🪑</a>

<p> 
	Hello first journal entry. Today I attached this journal entry and then lowkey studied for my math test. BUT for the last couple of weeks of Computer Science I have been understanding the codes we have been making-- like actually comprehending how it works. Although I understand it once its written, I still struggle to actually write a functioning code without help because it is so easy to make mistakes and I don't know all the little details. Missing one period can negate your whole code. Ok I'm going to make another project (cookie clicker?) and then next time I'm going to write another one of these and attach all of my projects to my projects page!
